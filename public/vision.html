        <p><b>Fish, cholesterol, fats, and omega-3/omega-6 fatty acids</b>
            <div class="box1">
            Multiple epidemiological studies have confirmed that dietary fish consumption and/or long-chain omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of AMD development and progression, and also the risk of developing advanced AMD. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), the BMES, and the NHS+HPFS all showed a decreased risk of any AMD with fish intake, as well as a reduced risk of neovascular AMD specifically, and more benefit was seen with increasing fish consumption.<br><br>
            </div>
            <div class="box2">
            The known presence of high quantities of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in fish has led to further investigations into long-chain fatty acid intake as a means of reducing AMD risk. Meta-analysis of multiple large studies has shown that consumption of high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids decreases the risk of AMD also that consuming >2 servings of fish per week reduces the risk of early and late AMD.31 Interestingly, an increased intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (predominantly linoleic acid) appears to be a risk for AMD in a range of studies, including the EDCC and NHS+HPFS.28,32 Dietary linoleic acid is obtained from a range of foods including animal protein sources and vegetable oils and seeds, and increased meat consumption has been linked to a greater risk of AMD (RR, 1.35; 95%CI, 1.07–1.69).28 However, the AREDS2 trial found no benefit for omega 3-supplementation in the prevention of AMD progression or visual loss.22 As participants in the study had a higher than normal baseline dietary intake,22 it is possible that this may have masked the effect of omega-3 supplements or increasing dietary intake in a normal patient population.<br><br>
            </div>
            <div class="box1">
            There is also some emerging evidence that the ratio of omega-6 PUFAs to omega-3 PUFAs may play a role in the pathophysiology and risk of AMD. In the BMES, researchers found those people who consumed higher long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in the presence of low omega-6 fatty acids had an approximately 50% reduced risk of incident early AMD after 10 years, but in the presence of high omega-6 fatty acids, high intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids was not protective.33 It has been hypothesized that polyunsaturated fatty acids are highly susceptible to oxidation in the eye, yet it is known that long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid, are prevalent in the eye and brain. It is possible these fatty acids work alongside the antioxidant properties of vitamins and other nutrients, such as the carotenoids found in dark-green leafy vegetables described earlier.<br><br>
            </div>
            <div class="box2">
            Interestingly, total fat intake has generally not been associated with an increased risk of AMD.34,35 Fat subtypes and their relationship to AMD have also been investigated, and there is conflicting evidence for an association between monounsaturated fat consumption and risk of AMD. Some studies have shown an increased risk with greater consumption, whilst others have shown no significant association after adjusting for consumption of other fat subtypes.28,35 Similarly, dietary cholesterol has variably been linked to AMD,32,36 although meta-analysis of available data found no association between either triglycerides or cholesterol/cholesterol subfractions and AMD.17</p>

        <h4>Common questions</h4>
        <p>Here are some of the most common questions that we get.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="foot">
            <div class="item">
            <h5>What is the importance of a healthy diet for vision impairment?</h5>
            <p>A healthy diet can help maintain overall eye health and reduce the risk of certain eye conditions associated with vision impairment.</p>
            <br>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
            <h5>What foods should be included in a diet plan for vision impairment?</h5>
            <p>Foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins A, C, and E, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc are beneficial for eye health and should be included in the diet plan.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
            <h5>Are there any foods that should be avoided for vision impairment?</h5>
            <p>Foods high in saturated fats, processed sugars, and excessive salt should be limited as they can have a negative impact on eye health.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
            <h5>How can nutrition supplements help in managing vision impairment?</h5>
            <p>Nutrition supplements containing lutein, zeaxanthin, and other eye-supporting nutrients can complement a healthy diet and support overall eye health.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
            <h5>Can diet alone improve vision impairment?</h5>
            <p>While a healthy diet plays a crucial role in supporting eye health, it is essential to consult with a healthcare provider for a comprehensive treatment plan that may include other interventions alongside diet.</p>
